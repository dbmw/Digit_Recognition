# Digit_Recognition
Kaggle Digit Recognition project with tensorflow

Code reference:
The code in this project has referred to the code in following websites:

https://www.kaggle.com/flaport/tensorflow-cnn-lb-0-98929
“A Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST Classification. This solution got me a score of 0.98929 on the leaderboard.”

“MINST进阶 | TensorFlow中文社区”

The structure of my neural network is also inspired by the following article:

“卷积神经网络中10大拍案叫绝的操作”

This is one of my homework in the course of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.In short, I have built up a neural network structure and made it work to classify different hand-written numbers.
Some of my contribution to the current code are introducing data augmentation, testing the effect of different models and adjusting parameters.
This code got a 99.485% correct rate in Kaggle, which was the 405th in 2018.5.25.
More detailed description was written in Chinese(which was my experiment record of the course), and I'll translate it if I have enough time.
More comments may be added to the code in future as well.
